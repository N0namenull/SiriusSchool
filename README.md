A simple project for a local exam preparation school like kompege<br>
Implementation using vanilla php + js + PDF.js lib<br><br>

The password to the admin panel is simply a hash, which is generated using the page if necessary. Since there is only one administrator, there is no need for a database.
Tasks are added either using the admin panel or manually. Tasks are stored in the tasks folder.<br>
The solution to the tasks looks like task number_resh.<br>
Supported assignment formats: pdf, jpg, png
